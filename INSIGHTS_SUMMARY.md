### Q5: Is there any plan that is discontinued after 5G launch? What is the reason?

**Answer:** No clear evidence of discontinued plans in available data

**Analysis:**
- Dashboard shows 12.6M unsubscribed users (TUsU)
- This indicates customer churn, not plan discontinuation
- Possible scenarios:
  - Customers migrated between plans
  - Some customers switched to competitors
  - Natural churn occurred during transition

**Recommendations:**
1. Conduct detailed plan-level subscription analysis
2. Track individual plan performance trends
3. Survey unsubscribed customers for reasons
4. Identify if specific plans are losing customers
5. Consider consolidating underperforming plan variants
