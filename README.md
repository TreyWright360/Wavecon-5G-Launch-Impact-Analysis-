## 🆘 Need Help?

### If slides are blurry:
- Re-export from PowerPoint at higher resolution (1920x1080 minimum)
- Check CapCut project settings are also 1920x1080

### If audio doesn't sync:
- Use CapCut's markers at exact timestamps
- Snap your slide changes to markers

### If video file is too large:
- Reduce bitrate to 8-10 Mbps in export settings
- Still maintain 1920x1080 resolution

### If you need shorter video:
- See "Alternative Shorter Timeline" in CAPCUT_TIMELINE_MAPPING.md
- Focus on slides 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 only (removes some detail slides)
- Results in ~2:45 video
